ClearPay is a modern responsive fintech website designed to make digital
payment services simple, clear, and easy to understand.

using any frontend framework.

## ✨ Main Features

### 1. Responsive Design

The website is designed to work across different screen sizes:

- Mobile devices
- Tablets
- Laptops
- Desktop screens
- Large screens up to 2560px

The layout adapts using CSS Grid, Flexbox, media queries, and responsive
design techniques.

### 2. Multi-Page Website

ClearPay contains the following pages:

- Home
- Features
- Pricing
- About
- Contact

Each page has consistent navigation, branding, styling, and responsive
behavior.

### 3. Pricing Calculator

The pricing page includes an interactive pricing calculator.

Users can enter:

- Monthly payment volume
- Number of transactions
- International transaction option
- Business size

The calculator then generates an estimated:

- Monthly cost
- Annual cost
- Effective rate
- Recommended plan

The calculation is performed using JavaScript.

### 4. Feature Filtering

The Features page contains filter buttons that allow users to filter
features by category.

Available categories include:

- All
- Payments
- Analytics
- Security
- Automation

The filtering is handled using Vanilla JavaScript.

### 5. Dark and Light Theme

ClearPay includes a theme toggle for switching between:

- Light Theme
- Dark Theme

The selected theme is saved using `localStorage`.

This means the selected theme remains available when the user revisits
the website.

---

### 6. Scroll Animations

The website uses the JavaScript `IntersectionObserver` API to reveal
elements as they enter the viewport.

This creates lightweight scroll-based animations without using external
animation libraries.

---

### 7. Contact Form Validation

The Contact page includes a validated contact form.

The form checks:

- Name
- Email
- Subject / reason
- Message

Validation messages are displayed when required information is missing
or invalid.

### 8. Accessibility

The website follows basic accessibility practices including:

- Semantic HTML5 elements
- Proper heading structure
- Form labels
- Keyboard focus states
- Accessible buttons
- Alternative text for images
- Skip navigation support
- Reduced motion support
